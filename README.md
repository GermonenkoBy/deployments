# Meteor deployment scripts

This repository contains docker compose scripts to run the system.

## Setup

Please note, some secret values are not stored in this repo,
so to run a script you'll need to provide some configuration values
like azure app configuration connection string or database credentials.

To do that I'd recommend creating `.env` file. This file is added to the `.gitignore`.
